What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--A .git directory is created when you initialize a repo. This enables us to track versions of the files after updates are made in the future. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
--The staging area is a temporary workspace and allows us to group various changes together for the same commit.
